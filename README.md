# BikeSharing
Within Tableau, used provided data to create a story and multiple dashboards to analyze and visualize CitiBikes data.  This required the use of Python and Jupyter notebook.

## Overview
The following are the challenge deliverables:
- Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
- Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
- Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Resources
- Dataset: downloaded 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip file from the CitiBike Link [CitiBike Public Link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html)
- Software:
  - Python
  - Pandas / Jupyter Notebook
  - Tableau Public

## Results
The presentation used data based on New York City in order to present a plan to expand to Des Moines, Iowa.  Based on the Tableau dashboard it can be determined whether to expand to Des Moines, and how much bike utilization is expected.  Before creating the Tableau dashboard I was required to convert data in [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Jahill17/bikesharing/blob/main/NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb).
